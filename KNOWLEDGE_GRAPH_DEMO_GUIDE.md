-   Development guidelines

**Expected Result**: Graph shows project concepts linking related documents, team roles connecting to relevant docs, and technology concepts shared across architecture documents.

### Scenario 2: Knowledge Base

Create documents about:

-   Product features and specifications
-   User guides and tutorials
-   Troubleshooting and FAQ
-   Technical reference materials

**Expected Result**: Feature concepts link user guides to technical docs, troubleshooting connects to related features, creating a navigable knowledge web.

### Scenario 3: Research & Analysis

Create documents about:

-   Research findings and data
-   Analysis methodologies
-   Literature reviews
-   Conclusion summaries

**Expected Result**: Research concepts bridge different studies, methodologies connect analysis docs, and themes emerge across the research corpus.

## üé™ Demo Presentation Tips

### 1. Setup Phase

-   Start with empty workspace to show the helpful guidance
-   Create 4-5 documents with interconnected content
-   Use varied content types (technical, planning, analysis)

### 2. Generation Phase

-   Click "Generate Graph" and explain the AI analysis process
-   Show the loading state with professional feedback
-   Highlight the statistics when graph appears

### 3. Interaction Phase

-   **Search demo**: Filter nodes to show specific concepts
-   **Navigation demo**: Click document nodes to show instant navigation
-   **Zoom demo**: Show detailed view of complex relationships
-   **Demo mode**: Toggle for enhanced visual effects

### 4. Technical Highlights

-   Explain the AI-powered concept extraction
-   Show different relationship types (contains, related, shares)
-   Demonstrate the intelligent grouping algorithm
-   Highlight the professional, scalable visualization
