# Knowledge Graph - Drag Enhancement Complete ✨

## Overview

The Knowledge Graph has been enhanced with advanced drag-and-drop functionality, making it even more interactive and visually appealing. Users can now drag nodes around to create custom layouts while enjoying smooth animations and professional visual feedback.

## 🎯 Enhanced Drag Features

### 1. **Smooth Drag Interaction**

-   **Grab & Drag**: Hover over any node to see grab cursor, click and drag to reposition
-   **Magnetic Snap**: Nodes automatically snap to a 20px grid for clean positioning
-   **Boundary Constraints**: Nodes stay within the graph bounds with proper padding
-   **Real-time Updates**: Connections update live as nodes are moved

### 2. **Advanced Visual Feedback**

-   **Hover Effects**: Smooth scale animations with glowing effects on hover
-   **Drag State**: Enhanced visual indicators when dragging (green glow, pulsing animation)
-   **Grab Cursors**: Professional cursor states (grab → grabbing)
-   **Ripple Effect**: Initial scale animation when starting drag
-   **Completion Animation**: Smooth return animation when drag ends

### 3. **Smart Positioning System**

-   **Grid Snapping**: 20px magnetic grid for professional alignment
-   **Boundary Enforcement**: 40px padding prevents nodes from touching edges
-   **Collision Avoidance**: Smart positioning prevents overlapping
-   **Transform Preservation**: Zoom level respected during drag operations

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**

-   **Visual Drag Indicator**: Live indicator showing drag state with instructions
-   **Interactive Tips**: Helpful guidance about drag functionality
-   **Smooth Transitions**: CSS cubic-bezier animations for professional feel
-   **Click vs Drag**: Smart detection to differentiate between clicks and drags
-   **Mobile Friendly**: Touch-optimized for mobile devices

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Event Handling

```typescript
// Advanced mouse event management
handleMouseDown(); // Initiate drag with visual feedback
handleMouseMove(); // Real-time position updates with snapping
handleMouseUp(); // Clean completion with animations
```

### Grid Snapping Algorithm

```typescript
const snapSize = 20;
newX = Math.round(newX / snapSize) * snapSize;
newY = Math.round(newY / snapSize) * snapSize;
```

### Boundary Constraints

```typescript
const padding = 40;
const constrainedX = Math.max(padding, Math.min(newX, 800 - padding));
const constrainedY = Math.max(padding, Math.min(newY, 600 - padding));
```

### Visual State Management

```typescript
// Enhanced visual feedback
if (draggedNode?.id === node.id) {
    circle.setAttribute("stroke", "#10b981");
    circle.setAttribute("stroke-width", "4");
    circle.setAttribute(
        "filter",
        "drop-shadow(0 8px 25px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.6))"
    );
    circle.setAttribute("transform", "scale(1.15)");

    // Pulsing animation
    const animate = document.createElementNS(
        "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg",
        "animate"
    );
    animate.setAttribute("attributeName", "r");
    animate.setAttribute(
        "values",
        `${nodeRadius};${nodeRadius + 2};${nodeRadius}`
    );
    animate.setAttribute("dur", "1s");
    animate.setAttribute("repeatCount", "indefinite");
}
```
