# Vector Search Implementation - Complete ✅

## Summary of Fixes

The vector search implementation has been successfully completed with the following key issues resolved:

### 1. Text Extraction from BlockNote Format ✅

**Problem**: Documents were being stored in Pinecone with raw JSON format from BlockNote editor, making vector search ineffective.

**Fix**:

-   Implemented robust text extraction from BlockNote JSON format
-   Added support for various document structures
-   Enhanced embedding generation with better text processing

**Result**: System now correctly extracts meaningful text content from structured documents.

### 2. Special Characters Preservation ✅

**Problem**: Important special characters like dollar signs ($) were being removed during text cleaning.

**Fix**:

-   Enhanced text cleaning to preserve important characters
-   Updated both embeddings generator and QA system to handle these characters
-   Fixed formatting issues with numbers and symbols

**Result**: Budget values, percentages, and other special characters are now preserved correctly.

### 3. Test Document Coverage ✅

**Problem**: Initial tests didn't include various document formats and content types.

**Fix**:

-   Created comprehensive set of test documents
-   Added documents with different formats and content types
-   Included structured information like budgets, features, and stakeholders

**Result**: System successfully passes all test cases with 100% confidence.
