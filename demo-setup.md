# Knowledge Graph Demo Setup

## Sample Documents for Knowledge Graph Demo

To demonstrate the Knowledge Graph feature effectively, create these sample documents:

### 1. Project Planning Documents

**Document: "Project Alpha - Overview"**
Content: "Project Alpha is our flagship AI-powered workspace application. The project involves developing advanced features like knowledge graphs, AI search, and document relationship mapping. Key technologies include React, Next.js, TypeScript, and machine learning algorithms. The team consists of frontend developers, backend engineers, and AI specialists."

**Document: "Project Alpha - Technical Architecture"**
Content: "The technical architecture for Project Alpha uses a modern stack: Next.js for the frontend framework, TypeScript for type safety, Convex for real-time backend, and React components for UI. The AI features are powered by Gemini API for natural language processing and Pinecone for vector embeddings. The knowledge graph uses D3.js for visualization."

**Document: "Project Alpha - Team Structure"**
Content: "Our development team is organized into specialized squads. The Frontend Team handles React components and user interface design. The Backend Team manages Convex database operations and API development. The AI Team focuses on machine learning integration, vector embeddings, and knowledge graph algorithms."

### 2. Technology Documentation

**Document: "React Development Guidelines"**
Content: "React development best practices for our team. Use TypeScript for all components, implement proper error boundaries, optimize with React.memo for performance, and follow the component composition pattern. All React components should be functional components with hooks. State management uses React context and Convex queries."

**Document: "TypeScript Configuration"**
Content: "TypeScript setup and configuration guidelines. Strict mode enabled, proper type definitions for all functions, interface definitions for data models, and generic types for reusable components. Integration with Next.js and React requires careful type checking for props and state."

**Document: "Next.js Application Structure"**
Content: "Next.js application architecture follows the app router pattern. API routes handle backend logic, server components for performance, client components for interactivity, and proper SEO optimization. Integration with TypeScript ensures type safety across the entire application stack."

### 3. AI Features Documentation

**Document: "Knowledge Graph Implementation"**
Content: "The knowledge graph feature analyzes document relationships using AI algorithms. Documents are processed to extract key concepts, topics, and semantic relationships. The visualization uses SVG graphics with force-directed layout algorithms. Users can interact with nodes, search for specific concepts, and navigate between related documents."

**Document: "Vector Search & Embeddings"**
Content: "Vector search implementation uses Pinecone database for storing document embeddings. Text content is converted to vector representations using machine learning models. Semantic search allows finding related documents based on meaning rather than keyword matching. The system integrates with Gemini API for advanced natural language processing."

**Document: "AI Search Assistant"**
Content: "The AI search assistant provides intelligent document discovery. Users can ask natural language questions about their workspace content. The system uses vector embeddings to find relevant documents and generates contextual answers. Integration with the knowledge graph provides visual exploration of search results."

### 4. Business & Strategy

**Document: "Product Roadmap 2025"**
Content: "Product development roadmap focuses on AI-powered features. Q1 priorities include knowledge graph visualization, advanced search capabilities, and document relationship mapping. Q2 will add collaborative features, real-time synchronization, and mobile applications. Machine learning improvements planned for Q3."

**Document: "User Experience Strategy"**
Content: "User experience design principles emphasize simplicity and powerful functionality. The interface should be intuitive for non-technical users while providing advanced features for power users. Knowledge graph visualization needs to be accessible, search results must be relevant, and document navigation should be seamless."

These documents will create a rich knowledge graph with multiple interconnected concepts like:

-   Technology nodes (React, TypeScript, Next.js, AI, Machine Learning)
-   Team/organizational concepts (Frontend Team, Backend Team, AI Team)
-   Feature concepts (Knowledge Graph, Vector Search, AI Assistant)
-   Project concepts (Project Alpha, Development, Architecture)

The AI will identify relationships between documents that share these concepts, creating an interesting and demo-worthy visualization.
